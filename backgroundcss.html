    The act of making a 2D image with a mobile phone camera. The display of the mobile phone shows the image being made.
    An image is a visual representation of something. It can be two-dimensional, three-dimensional, or somehow otherwise feed into the visual system to convey information. An image can be an artifact, such as a photograph or other two-dimensional picture, that resembles a subject. In the context of signal processing, an image is a distributed amplitude of color(s).[1]
    
    In optics, the term "image" may refer specifically to a 2D image.
    
    An image does not have to use the entire visual system to be a visual representation. A popular example of this is of a greyscale image, which uses the visual system's sensitivity to brightness across all wavelengths, without taking into account different colors. A black and white visual representation of something is still an image, even though it does not make full use of the visual system's capabilities.
    
    Images are typically still, but in some cases can be moving or animated.
    
    Characteristics
    
    An rynthetic-aperture radar image acquired by the SIR-C/X-SAR radar on board the Space Shuttle Endeavour shows the Teide volcano. The city of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is visible as the purple and white area on the lower right edge of the island. Lava flows at the summit crater appear in shades of green and brown, while vegetation zones appear as areas of purple, green and yellow on the volcano's flanks
    Images may be two or three-dimensional, such as a photograph or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a statue or hologram. They may be captured by optical devices â€“ such as cameras, mirrors, lenses, telescopes, microscopes, and natural objects and phenomena, such as the human eye or water.
    
    The word 'image' is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a map, graph, pie chart, painting or banner. In this wider sense, images can also be rendered manually, such as by drawing, the art of painting, carving, rendered automatically by printing or computer graphics tec
